            <p>I have chosen Benjamin Moore Slate Blue paint for all walls of the room, teamed with bright white paint for skirting, coving and ceiling. There are nautical elements to this design through use of artwork and accessories. The dining chairs would be reupholstered using blue and white striped linen fabric. Glassware and dinnerware would continue in blue however of different tints and shades from one another adding contrast. The flooring would be white ash wood continuing with the coastal palette. Accessories such as tea light holders and nautical inspired bottles would complement the scheme and give the desired effect. Shutter blinds would be added as a window treatment. A sideboard for additional storage purposes will be added and complements the table and chairs. Rustic photo frames would be incorporated to add a more personal feel to the room as well as continuing with the Coastal feel. There would be 2 ceiling pendants above the table adding drama to the design as well as an additional feature. This mood board gives the overall desired effect of the design and does not include all the elements that would be considered.</p>
